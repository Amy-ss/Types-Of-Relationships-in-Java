# Types-Of-Relationships-in-Java

A relationship in Java means different relations between two or more classes.


Inheritance (“Is-A”) Relationship in Java:
Inheritance represents Is-a relationship in Java. It establishes a relationship between a more general class (known as superclass) and a more specialized class (known as subclass).
In other words, Is-A relationship defines the relationship between two classes in which one class extends another class.


Association (“Has-A”) Relationship in Java:
Association is another fundamental relationship between classes that is informally known as “Has-A” relationship.
When an object of one class is created as data member inside another class, it is called association relationship in java or simply Has-A relationship.

Dependence (Uses-A) Relationship in Java:
When we create an object of a class inside a method of another class, this relationship is called dependence relationship in Java, or simply Uses-A relationship.
In other words, when a method of a class uses an object of another class, it is called dependency in java. It is the most obvious and most general relationship in java.
